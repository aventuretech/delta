Instructions for changing the font:

1. Get BMFont from http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/. I'm developing on Ubuntu,
   so just get Wine (sudo apt-get install wine), run the installer, and then run BMFont
   (wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/AngelCode/BMFont/bmfont.exe).

2. In BMFont, press "F". Select "Add Font File" and choose the TTF in this folder.

3. If "Font Smoothing" is checked, deselect it. Now choose your character height.

4. In "Export Options", make sure "Font Descriptor" is set to XML, and "Textures" is set to PNG.

5. Select the main ASCII characters (Space through "~").

6. Press Control-S. Choose to overwrite vcr_osd_mono.fnt.

7. Run bmfont2c.py and rebuild Delta. Your font is changed!
