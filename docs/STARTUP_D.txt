About the startup.d file:

Once the kernel is finished loading its internal tasks, it needs a system
to load. With Delta, this comes in the form of files on the boot partition.
The kernel needs to know these files' names and what to do with them (load
them in user space, kernel space, load to memory without executing, etc.). So,
it looks for a file named startup.d that has a list of files and what to do 
with them.

SYNTAX:
<filename>:<mode>

Available modes are:
 - 'u'    means load in user mode
 - 'k'    means load in user mode
 - 'lX'   means load at address X

So, an example would be:
testing.exdf:u

OR:
notify_on_startup.txt:l0x10000
